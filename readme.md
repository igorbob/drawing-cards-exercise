## Drawing cards exercise

This is a simple Laravel/php application made as an exercise in compliance with the requirements (as found in requirements.txt). It lets a user pick one card and then allows the user to draw cards one at a time until the selected card is found. On each draw the probability of getting the selected card is presented. The only Javascript used in this project is to present the user with an alert. A running demo can be found [here](http://assesment-card-game.herokuapp.com/).
